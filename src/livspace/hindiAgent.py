            Call this function when you detect that the call recipient is not available and the call has been answered by an automated voicemail system.

            Common indicators of voicemail:
            - Automated greeting messages: "You have reached the voicemail of..."
            - Recording instructions: "Please leave a message after the beep/tone"
            - Voicemail system prompts: "Please leave your name and number"
            - Generic unavailable messages: "The number you have dialed is not available"

            Before calling this function:
            - Provide a specific reason referencing the actual voicemail content heard

            After calling this function:
            - If a voicemail message is configured, it will be played automatically
            - The call will end immediately after the message (or immediately if no message)
            - No further conversation will take place

            You must provide a specific reason for detecting voicemail that references the exact wording that indicated voicemail.

            EXAMPLE FLOWS:

            Example 1 (clear voicemail greeting):
            System plays: "Hi, you've reached Sarah. I'm not available right now. Please leave a message after the beep."
            Assistant: [voicemail_detection function called with reason="automated greeting detected: 'Hi, you've reached Sarah. I'm not available right now. Please leave a message after the beep.'"]

            Example 2 (generic voicemail):
            System plays: "The number you have dialed is not available. At the tone, please leave a message."
            Assistant: [voicemail_detection function called with reason="voicemail instruction detected: 'The number you have dialed is not available. At the tone, please leave a message.'"]

            Example 3 (DO NOT call - human response):
            Human: "Hello? Who is this?"
            Assistant: [follows system prompt and conversation objectives rather than calling voicemail_detection]

            You must provide a specific reason for detecting voicemail. Never call this tool without a valid reason.
            The reason must include a specific reference to the wording in the user message that indicates voicemail."""
